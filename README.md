# Specific

In this week we learned about web design and development, learning about web design and web publishing, in practical 1 we went through designing our own web page using some free css and publishing it

#Measurable

shop page： Show what game we have

#Attainable

I chose to find some free CSS templates online, and then I chose to use vscode to edit my HTML, and then put it into my github, and used github to generate my site

#Relevant

I think these things will help me in my next two assessments, and learning how to publish a website will save me a lot of time in the future doing my work

#Time-bound

The practical took me three hours to complete on a Saturday afternoon, and I didn't do much work during the process, but rather kept checking out materials such as YouTube to view videos, learn how to publish a website and some web design tips.
